# Dream Planner
Everyone has a dream vacation in their bucketlist.  We're here to bring those dreams closer to reality with a budget tracker.  Users can post and share their dream vacation and calculate how much they need to save each week to make it happen.  Once the user goes on their vacation, they can add actual expenses to the trips.

Users can share their expenses to others to help other see how much it really costs.
